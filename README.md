## Project Overview

This is part of Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree. I am presenting my work of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project.
In this project, I am building a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images.
Given an image, the algorithm will predict the most likely locations where the image was taken.

## Dataset Info

The landmark images are a subset of the Google Landmarks Dataset v2. If you are using the
classroom workspace, the dataset is provided therein; otherwise it can be obtained using
[this link](https://udacity-dlnfd.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/datasets/landmark_images.zip).

You can find license information for the full dataset [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/google/google-landmarks-dataset).
